        <h2>So What IS a Chicken Karahi?</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>In the context of the curry, a Chicken Karahi is a tomato and ginger based, thick masala curry which is
            though to originate from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region. The original, authentic method of making it is a
            very specific one. As a general rule, Karahis are made from a base of ginger, garlic and tomatoes and also
            contain fresh green chillis, julienne-cut raw ginger and coriander. It’s a rather thick, jammy gravy and
            concentrated in flavour – yum!</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>The traditional Karahi has undergone pretty major alterations over time</strong>. In order to bulk up
            the masala gravy
            and also cut the cost, onions have been added in so frequently in restaurants that many people know don’t
            even know the real recipe doesn’t contain onion. I’ve also seen variations use large chunks of red onion and
            capsicum much like a <a href="https://fatimacooks.net/chicken-jalfrezi-recipe/">Chicken Jalfrezi</a>. Modern
            day conveniences such as tinned tomatoes and pre-packaged jars
            of ginger and garlic are also pretty normal too.

            The recipe and instructions I’m sharing with you today is for the REAL DEAL Chicken Karahi. No bulking up
            with onions, everything is fresh, crisp and simple. It’s as close to the real deal as you can get, really. I
            want to break down EVERYTHING to you before proceeding on to the recipe, because if you can’t already tell,
            I am absolutely INSANE about getting Karahis right!

        <h2>The Main Components of a Karahi</h2>
        <p>
            <hr>
            Just to lay thiis straight before we proceed with more information, this
            is what a Karahi consists of
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b> Your Meat</b> - This could be lamb, mutton, beef, fish etc. For
                this we're using chicken obviously. In terms of what kind of chicken
                to get, any bone-in medium chicken will suffice. In this recipe, I've
                used a rather small chicken which was only 550g in total weight. If
                your chicken weighs more, please do make adjustments for the
                quantities of tomatoes, spices and oil
            </li><br>
            <li>
                <b>Fresh Ginger</b> - this is a very defining component of any Karahi. We use
                ginger in both the curry gravy as well as in the garnish in its raw
                form. Ginger is a very prominent flavour of a Karahi, so this is
                definitely not something to skimp on! Use a heavy hand with this!
            </li><br>
            <li>
                <b> Fresh Garlic</b> - another important component of the Karahi, however its
                flavour definitely does take a backseat in comparison to its
                aforementioned brother, ginger. Use a heavy hand with this too! We use
                quite a lot of garlic in Karahis to help bulk up the masala too, since
                there aren't any onions in here.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                <b> Fresh Tomatoes</b> - A Karahi is a tomato based curry. The original,
                traditional recipe does not contain onions. I will repeat this again
                (and again and again) - onions have been added into mainstream Karahis
                for the sole reason that it bulks up the masala on the cheap. My
                recipe doesn't use onions because quite frankly I'm a Karahi purist
                and if it contains onions, it ain't a Karahi to me!
            </li><br>
            <li>
                <b> Fresh Green Chilli + Coriander</b> - adds another fresh flavour element to
                the Karahi playing into the natural, crisp flavours of Karahis and
                also adds a wonderful fragrance.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                <b> Spices</b> - The spices in a Karahi are rather simple. This allows the
                natural flavours of the tomatoes, ginger, garlic etc all to shine!
            </li>
        </ul><br><br><br>

        <h2>How to Make Chicken Karahi</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The following is a basic outline of what we do to make a REAL, authentic Chicken Karahi. Don't worry, there’s
            more detailed instructions, pictures and exact quantities at the end!</p>
        <ol>
            <li>We start by frying the chicken in a generous amount of oil. We can’t really get away from the oil here,
                soz.</li><br>
            <li>We than add in <strong>a LOT of minced ginger and garlic</strong>. Please none of that pre-made, jarred
                stuff. FRESH
                ginger and garlic is KEY here. Remember I said Karahis have a huge emphasis on fragrance and natural
                flavours? These two ingredients are a MAJOR component of that. We want to fry these just enough for the
                raw smell to go away – under no circumstances should you allow this to burn because it will taint the
                flavour of the Karahi.</li><br>
            <li>We then go ahead and add all our tomatoes and spices. The tomatoes will release TONS of moisture and
                will break down into a beautifully jammy, thick gravy that will coat the chicken.</li><br>
            <li>We allow this mix to cook on high, stirring as needed to make sure it doesn’t catch at the bottom of the
                pan. We <strong>don’t put the lid on</strong> because we are concentrating the flavour. <strong>If we
                    put the lid on, we won’t
                    get that true Karahi look or flavour because we will be containing the moisture in our pan, not
                    allowing
                    the flavours to concentrate</strong>. The result will be a boiled/steamed chicken that looks more
                like a red
                chicken shorba and will likely break/flake. Not ideal for a Karahi!</li><br>
            <li>At about the 15-20 minute mark, the gravy will have thickened nicely, the oil will be separating around
                the edges, the chicken will be cooked and things will be looking almost done. At this point, you can add
                the chopped coriander and chillis, turn the heat to low and allow everything to simmer together again
                without the lid. It can simmer for 5 minutes at this point</li><br>
            <li>It’s all ready! Now you can garnish with your slices of ginger and serve as you please</li>

        </ol>
